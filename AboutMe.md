Hi, I am Kellen Bavis and I am currently in my Senior Year here at University at Albany. I am a Computer Science major and a Mathmatics minor. I am hoping to be able to further my software engineering knowledge throughout the course of this semester. I can't wait to start the software development life cycle and be able to work in a team environment while doing so. Over the course of the summer, I engaged in a software engineering internship where I developed an application. It is currently in its inital phase of testing and validation.
